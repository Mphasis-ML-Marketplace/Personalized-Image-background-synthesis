# Personalized-Image-background-synthesis
This solution can synthesize varied backgrounds for an image containing a subject, whether a human subject or any specific character/object and enables editing of unique scenes described in the text prompt. 



Usage Methodology for the algorithm: 
1) The input must be 'Input.zip' file. 
2) The zip file should contain input file which includes a .json file. 
3) The name of the .json file should be "parameters" which is case sensitive.
4) the parameter file should contain key-value pair similar to sample input.
5) Name of the folder inside the zip file should be “input” which is case-sensitive
6) Minimum four Sample images of Subject must be kept in folder named "image".
7) Check the instructions and sample endpoint in the sample jupyter file provided.
